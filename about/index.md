**A little some some about me**

From Econometrics and Statistics fields, I started naturally selling myself as a Data Scientist implementing machine learning algorithms with massive data. I quickly met a constraint in computer science concept and knowledges, such as intensive use of SQL, Java oriented distributed frameworks, clustering, data center concepts, GPU oriented algorithms, and so on.
After working for more than 2 years as a Hadoop Administrator, a technical support many big data analytics products such as Dataiku, Pivotal HAWQ, SPSS Analytics Server, I can say today that I am a full Data Scientist.

With Machine Learning and Deep Learning powered by the open source community, I am very proud to be at the edge of these knowledges. Supervised and unsupervised learning, convolutional Neural Networks, Natural language processing.
