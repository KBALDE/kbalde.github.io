After some experiences in Data Science and Data Analysis, now am working as a Big Data Solution Architect at Orange. My day-to-day job is to test big data softwares that use data from a hadoop cluster with all security and architecture constraints. in this process of building proof of concept for those products, I am the main technical support to perform troubleshooting and provide expertise for installation, configuration, DevOps tasks. I work with software editors and Use-Case managers (developers and analysts) to validate the integration of new big data products.


I am more of a Statistician that, from computer science knowledges constraint in his way up to Data Science carier profile, is doing almost everything around Big Data:

  - **Data Ingestion**: fetch the data where it is produced using the right technology to store it in a well designed Data Lake.
  
  - **Data Analysis**: with respect to the type of data (structuured or unstructured), the best technology process the data (requesting, building new indicators), using the right programing language,
  
  - **Data visualization**: it is always interesting to visualize the data.
  
  - **Machine Learning**: after feature engineering, we need to enpower our data by not only learn from it, but make it help tranform and faciltate our environment for good.
